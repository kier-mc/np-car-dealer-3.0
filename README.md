# Front End Technical Challenge

## Introduction

I was tasked with recreating a design provided via Figma, incorporating an external API and paginating the results. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/maxswann-nexuspoint/fe-tech-test).

## Instructions

If you want to build the project locally, clone the repo, install the deps and run:

```bash
bun run dev
```
